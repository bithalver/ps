Szia,

Hi,

My name is Laszlo Meszaros, I live in Hungary.
I'm 31 years old, and I gradueted in computer programming in 1990.
I work as an HP-UX specialist system engineer  for Synergon ltd, 
the biggest system integrator company in Hungary.

Let's talk about the
                     Search for the Pattern

I started drawing this kind of picture 10 years ago, when I was a student in Szeged. The next 9 year passed in relatively silence: I didn't make too much work in this area, however I didn't forget the idea.
The next important date is the July-August of last year: I had a
brainstorm: to make the whole thing on a computer. So, because I'm a
computer programmer, I made it. (If it's understandable for you, I made it in pure, native PostScript. No other programming language was involved.) It have been a very enjoyable work to do !
The base element is the same for all pictures; I call it just simply the _net_. The trickiest thing about it that it looks like if it contains a curve, but it made only from straight lines !
The very first drawing has a trick in it: if you join a square to each side of a regular hexagon, then the gaps will be regular triangles, and the outer edges make a regular 12-sided polygon.
The first of my drawings had been made only around regular polygons, but later I tried not-so-regular and irregular ones too.
The next idea came in September, 1998. I wanted to see the drawings in color _and_ I wanted to give them a thickness, so I decided to make them on a special, very thick (>200 g/m2) paper with embroidery thread. Yes, the pure old technique: with needle.
The first ones took more than 3 hours to make, and I have a very special one that took more than 5 hours. Nowadays the average is between 1 and 1 1/2 hour; however, I make simplier pieces in half hour, but I make more sophisticated ones in more than 2 hours.
At the time of writing I made more than 20 for present, and I have 75 in my "private gallery": on my wall.
So, you can ask me, why I make them (both on computer and on paper) ?
Because, I like to make it.
Because, I like to see that simple straight lines form a difficult pattern.
And, at last but not least, I like to search for these patterns.
